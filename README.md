# power-system-simulation

Due to global warming and the need for something more environmentally friendly, the world is looking for other options. Searching for those options led to the use of  renewable energy sources like solar cells and wind turbines. There is a problem with these however, for we canâ€™t know and control when and how much energy these produce. This results in uncertainties in the electrical grid. These uncertainties require applying statistical methods and relevant data science techniques in the design and operation of the grid. This student project implements some of these methods and techniques on testing data.

This package aims to provide some overarching functions for optimizing power grids, and handling grid fault by finding alternative grid topologies.
